# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 2nd 2023

**Today's Progress**: Didn't really do much, I'm going to try to use this challenge to expand my horizons and learn more than just Python - starting with java. Managed to make a very simple "Hello World!" program in the hour after spending some time messing with IDE's and doing research.

**Thoughts**: Java definitely seems more difficult than Python, although I expected that so I'm not particularly discouraged. I've found some pretty helpful resources like this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIrMbAQSU34 which I'm sure I'll be referring back to freuently when I get confused.
